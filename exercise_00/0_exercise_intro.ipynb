    "In the following notebooks, we will introduce you to the exercises and the submission system for *Computer Vision 3 - Detection, Segmentation*, and Tracking for the *Winter Semester 2023/24*. We prepared 3 Notebooks for you that you can work through to familiarize yourself with the workflow of the exercises during the semester. In this exercise we will guide you through setting up your working environment - either on your personal machine or in google colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 2 Notebooks will introduce you to pytorch based on the official pytorch tutorials you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html). Check it out if you want an even more detailed introduction.\n",

    "The final notebook will setup a small training example for images. Here, you will be given the task of implementing several image augmentations on your own. You then have the opportunity to upload your submission to the test server. This exercise is **not** counted towards the grade bonus, so you do not need to worry about correct implementations.\n",

    "#### ❗️ INFO\n",
    "We strongly encourage you to take this opportunity to test the submission system. This is your time to ask us any questions about the exercise submission. Starting with the first exercise, we will **not** answer any questions related to the submission process itself.\n",

    "Before tackling pytorch and the coding exercises, we need to setup our environment first. We require quite a few different python modules throughout these exercises. Depending on whether you use `google colab` or work locally, the setup looks a bit different. As `google colab` does not support `conda` natively, we give you instructions for installing all the packages with `pip`. These instructions are repeated in each exercise script if necessary. However, we still recommend you to try it here. For a local python environment, we recommend you to use conda as installing torch via `pip` is quite tricky."
